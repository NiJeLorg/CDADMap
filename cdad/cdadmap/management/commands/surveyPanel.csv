Our mission is to improve the environment and strengthen the economy of Southwest Detroit. We work together with residents, community organizations, government agencies, schools, businesses and industry to combat environmental issues, including: indoor and outdoor air quality, blight (illegal dumping, graffiti, abandoned homes), and incompatible land use. SDEV’s work would not be possible without the dedication of our community volunteers.|sdevweb.info@gmail.com|Yes|https://www.facebook.com/pages/Southwest-Detroit-Environmental-Vision/81072456431?ref=bookmarks|sdevweb.org|@SDEVweb|undefined|Southwest Detroit|Specific Geographic Boundaries||501c(3) (e.g., charitable non-profits)|Yes|14|1-5|Community Organizing and Engagement,Land Use and/or Community Planning,Public Spaces, Parks, or Recreation(e.g. streetscapes, community cleanups, green/open space development),Neighborhood Safety,Education,Community Gardening, Agriculture and/or Food Systems,Environmental,Vacant Property / Blight Removal,Neighborhood Beautification|Low-income individuals,Moderate-income individuals,Children / Youth,Seniors,Immigrants, Refugees or non-English speakers,Businesses,Schools,Neighborhood or Community Groups,Faith Institutions,Governmental Institutions|English|Clean Diesel Program|This program focuses on reducing diesel emissions from on-road trucks, off-road equipment, marine engines and other sources of diesel pollution. SDEV partners with local businesses to apply for grant funding to assist them with upgrading and retrofitting their diesel engines. SDEV has secured more than $12-million in government grants and private investments to reduce diesel pollution in the community.  To date, SDEV’s clean diesel efforts reduce more than 4,500 tons of diesel emissions annually.|Safe Routes to Schools (SR2S)|SR2S mission is to reduce childhood health diseases such as childhood obesity and childhood diabetes by increasing physical activity such as walking, biking, rollerblading or strolling on the route to school. We recruit parent volunteers to walk with kids to school, hold an annual "walk to school day", and organize other safety initiatives with students and parents. SDEV secured $400,000 from MDOT through the Michigan Fitness Foundation for infrastructure improvements around Bennett Elementary, including defective sidewalk replacement, installing ADA ramps and signage for pedestrian safety. This year, Clippert Academy is also joining the SR2S program, working with SDEV to implement a walking club with the students.|Annual Tire Sweep Challenge|For more than 10 years, SDEV has been holding an annual three day tire sweep every summer, working with volunteers to collect illegally dumped tires from Southwest Detroit neighborhoods. This year SDEV (District 6) challenged the Brightmoor Neighborhood (District 1) to see who could collect the most tires over three days. Together we collected more than 8,000 tires and had them taken to a recycling plant or gave them to Cass Community Social Services to be made into useful products. We hope to expand the tire sweep challenge to include all neighborhoods in the City.|Cadillac Urban Gardens on Merritt Street (CUGM)|CUGM is a collaborative project between SDEV, the Ideal Group, GM, businesses, residents, and volunteers that aims to create a zero waste garden while providing residents with fresh fruits and vegetables as well as a community gathering space.  The Ideal Group donated a vacant, former Cadillac Executive Parking lot as the space for the project, while GM repurposed 250 shipping crates to be used as raised vegetable planter beds. SDEV helped design the garden, and is responsible for managing the volunteer activities and maintaining the space. This year volunteers spent more 7,000 hours working in the garden. Most of the volunteers are children and young people. From residents to school groups to volunteer corps, CUGM sees dozens of new and familiar faces every week. The garden is open daily, so residents can come and pick what they need, and baskets of produce are put out daily for anyone in need to take home.|48210 Clean Up Collaborative|SDEV recently received an EPA Environmental Justice grant to address solid waste issues in the 48210 zip code. We will convene a diverse stakeholder collaborative who will identify two or three illegal dump sites to clean up and then repurpose into something that the community wants. -\tIncrease awareness of illegal dumping and proper solid waste disposal. The purpose of the program is to reduce the number of repeat dump sites; Reduce residents’ exposure to hazardous waste; Develop new community asset(s) i.e. parks, gardens or greenhouses; Reduce amount of material entering waste stream; And reuse, recycle and repurpose as much dumped material as possible.|Bridging Communities, Inc.,Brightmoor Alliance,Cass Community Social Services,City of Detroit - Building Safety Engineering(BSEED),City of Detroit - City Planning Commission (CPC),City of Detroit - Planning and Development Department (PDD),Congress of Communities,Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice (DWEJ),Doing Development Differently in Detroit (D4),EcoWorks (formally WARM Training Center),Erb Family Foundation,Michigan Community Resources (MCR),Skillman Foundation,Southwest Detroit Business Association (SDBA),Southwest Detroit Community Benefits Coalition,University of Michigan - Urban &amp; Regional Planning Program,Urban Neighborhood Initiatives,ACCESS; Forgotten Harvest; NextEnergy,[object Object]|Interested in learning more about membership|Policy Advocacy,Community/Neighborhood Planning,Community Engagement,Technical Assistance,Training|undefined|The survey was easy to complete.

The FREE Project aims to address issues of social justice, restorative justice, and Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED). This framework includes three key components.\n\n1) Large scale vacant lot blight removal project via Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs); construction contractors registered with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). This provides much needed on-the-job training for DBEs who wish to become more involved in MDOTs projects.\n\n2) Workforce development and training opportunities for individuals who have a desire to become more involved in construction work, are unemployed, or face barriers to employment.\n\n3) Community-led redesign and maintenance efforts of the formerly blighted stretch of vacancy. Anchoring institutions and surrounding community stakeholders serve an irreplaceable role in the fight against blight.|gruberjk@gmail.com|Yes|No page yet... stay tuned!|No web yet... stay tuned!|No Twitter yet... stay tuned!|None yet... stay tuned!|Neighborhood,City of Detroit,Wayne County,Regional (Metro Detroit),State of Michigan|Both|No Data Yet|Master of Community Development Capstone Project, soon will be a year-long Fellowship through University of Detroit Mercy, ultimately handed off as a project to an organizations|No|undefined|No Employees / Not Applicable|Community Organizing and Engagement,Economic Development (e.g. business development, job training),Land Use and/or Community Planning,Public Spaces, Parks, or Recreation(e.g. streetscapes, community cleanups, green/open space development),Neighborhood Safety,Construction, Deconstruction, or Demolition,Vacant Property / Blight Removal,Neighborhood Beautification|Low-income individuals,Moderate-income individuals,Children / Youth,Businesses,Schools,Neighborhood or Community Groups,Faith Institutions,Governmental Institutions,Indiviudals with Barriers to Employment|English|FREE Project Pilot|Our pilot project is located in McDougall-Hunt, a neighborhood on Detroits near east side. We are partnering with the Bailey Park Project, a 501(c)3 dedicated to maintaining vacant lot throughout McDougall-Hunt while providing increased safety and improved quality of life for residents and surrounding school children.\n\nThe pilot site is 16 contiguous parcels, all vacant and in a significant state of disrepair - beyond the control of a small landscaping organization. Therefore, weve partnered with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program to perform initial phases of large scale blight removal. This project will be designed as a training program for the DBEs who wish to become more involved with MDOT Projects.\n\nThe residents and surrounding stakeholders have provided individual designs, which will be compiled into one professional design, and further synthesized into the blight removal/training program job specifications and work contract.|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|ARISE Detroit,Detroit Collaborative Design Center (DCDC),Detroit Future City (DFC),McDougall-Hunt Citizens District Council,University of Detroit Mercy - Master of Community Development Program,W.K.

(Conner Cluster)\n\nBetter Block Detroit 2014 (BBD2014) will focus its rapid planning activities along Gratiot Avenue, between Conner and Rosemary. This corridor, while heavily trafficked by cars, bikes and pedestrians, lacks cohesive social and retail-based connectivity. Khalil Ligon, longtime district resident, urban planner and CEO of Vista Vantage Consulting Group, L3C, is leading the effort in partnership with the USGBC Detroit Regional Chapter Emerging Professionals. The group sought to involve active community groups in this area as well as green businesses across Detroit to design, implement and steward the project towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly development.\n\nBBD2014 will take place October 20-25. Our team of community members and the USGBC Emerging Professionals have been meeting since mid-September to identify and program a space in the neighborhood. The area we selected along Gratiot Avenue has a mix of active and vacant spaces. We want to create an informal gathering space that brings some vibrancy to the block and demonstrates what’s possible with more planning & resources. The site will feature community gathering spaces, pop-up shops, urban stormwater management and mock-protected bike lanes.\n\nBetter Block is not an event; rather, it is a quick neighborhood turnaround project to simulate an active, thriving block in a major city. Better Block is Detroit’s opportunity to take an idea and make it live in a relatively short period of time. Better Block Detroit provides a unique opportunity for Detroiters to come together and create their own vision of what everyday business and entertainment can look like.|DRC Forum|No Data Yet|Students Sustainability Conference|No Data Yet|Green Apple Day of Service|No Data Yet|Ongoing LEED building tours and education|No Data Yet|ARISE Detroit,Community Development Advocates of Detroit (CDAD),D:Hive,Detroit Economic Growth Corporation (DEGC),Detroit Future City (DFC),Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice (DWEJ),EcoWorks (formally WARM Training Center),Habitat for Humanity of Detroit,Michigan Nonprofit Association,North End Woodward Community Coalition (NEWCC),Tech Town Detroit,Transit Riders United (TRU),ushers new look, build on, Detroit Public Schools,[object Object]|Interested in learning more about membership|Community/Neighborhood Planning,Community Engagement,Training|undefined|undefined

The 2014 fall semester (Oct-Dec 2014) launched with 29 students and concluded with a total of 26 students.  The semester featured a student exhibition and opening reception in the Focus: HOPE Art Gallery on December 11th. The exhibition officially runs through February 15.  Thus far, the 2015 Winter/Spring semester has 17 students enrolled. We will continue to recruit through early February.  On Tuesday, January 20, the students conducted an assignment on abstract photography at the North American International Auto Show. The Excel Photography Program received 3 grants for 2015: National Endowment for the Arts ($20,000), Michigan Council for the Arts and Cultural Affairs ($13,875), and the Detroit Auto Dealers Association ($25,000). Each grant also includes funding for Excel’s summer component where students are involved in community place making by printing their images large-scale on vinyl and installed on vacant buildings in the HOPE Village.|Generation of Promise (GOP)|Generation of Promise carried out its ‘Cultural Diversity’ and ‘Critical Issues’ program day events with its current Class XXIV in November and December of 2014. During the ‘Cultural Diversity’ event, students were divided into focus groups to explore ethnic or cultural groups by immersing themselves into the local community. Students visited various institutions such as the: Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue (IADS), ChabaD Greater Downtown Detroit, DABLS African Bead Gallery, Cesar Chavez Academy, and listened to the musical styling’s of the infamous Detroit jazz artist Gaylelynn McKinney. During GOP’s ‘Critical Issues,’ program day, students explored various critical issues that leave members of our society on the fringes such as living with a disability, homelessness and poverty, and crime and justice. Students visited Freedom House, the Jerry L. White Center High School, the Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan, and On the Rise Bakery to name a few. Currently, GOP’s Class XXIV is completing their student exchange experience. Each student selects a student partner with whom they create a mini student-exchange experience. Through shared coordination, each student spends a full day at the host student’s school and later hosts that partner student at his/her own school.|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|No Data Yet|Central Detroit Christian CDC,Community Development Advocates of Detroit (CDAD),Detroit Future City (DFC),Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA),Detroit Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC),Detroit Police Department,Detroit Soup,Eastern Market Corporation,EcoWorks (formally WARM Training Center),Gleaners Community Food Bank of Southeastern Michigan,Knight Foundation,Michigan Community Resources (MCR),Michigan Nonprofit Association,Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA),Transform Detroit,University of Michigan - Urban &amp; Regional Planning Program,University of Michigan Law School - Community &amp; Economic Development Clinic,[object Object]|Currently a member|Policy Advocacy,Community/Neighborhood Planning,Community Engagement,Technical Assistance,Training|undefined|undefined
