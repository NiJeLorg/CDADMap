15	Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision	SDEV	Sarah Hoogterp	sarah.sdev@gmail.com	Yes	Community Development Organization	1992	SDEV logo.jpg	Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision (SDEV) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit membership organization. Our mission is to improve the environment and strengthen the economy of Southwest Detroit. We work together with residents, community organizations, government agencies, schools, businesses and industry to combat environmental issues, including: indoor and outdoor air quality, blight (illegal dumping, graffiti, abandoned homes), and incompatible land use. SDEV’s work would not be possible without the dedication of our community volunteers.	sdevweb.info@gmail.com	Yes	https://www.facebook.com/pages/Southwest-Detroit-Environmental-Vision/81072456431?ref=bookmarks	sdevweb.org	@SDEVweb	undefined	Southwest Detroit	Specific

Institutions	English	Clean Diesel Program	This program focuses on reducing diesel emissions from on-road trucks, off-road equipment, marine engines and other sources of diesel pollution. SDEV partners with local businesses to apply for grant funding to assist them with upgrading and retrofitting their diesel engines. SDEV has secured more than $12-million in government grants and private investments to reduce diesel pollution in the community.  To date, SDEV’s clean diesel efforts reduce more than 4,500 tons of diesel emissions annually.	Safe Routes to Schools (SR2S)	SR2S mission is to reduce childhood health diseases such as childhood obesity and childhood diabetes by increasing physical activity such as walking, biking, rollerblading or strolling on the route to school. We recruit parent volunteers to walk with kids to school, hold an annual "walk to school day", and organize other safety initiatives with students and parents. SDEV secured $400,000 from MDOT through the Michigan Fitness Foundation for infrastructure improvements around Bennett Elementary, including defective sidewalk replacement, installing ADA ramps and signage for pedestrian safety. This year, Clippert Academy is also joining the SR2S program, working with SDEV to implement a walking club with the students.	Annual Tire Sweep Challenge	For more than 10 years, SDEV has been holding an annual three day tire sweep every summer, working with volunteers to collect illegally dumped tires from Southwest Detroit neighborhoods. This year SDEV (District 6) challenged the Brightmoor Neighborhood (District 1) to see who could collect the most tires over three days. Together we collected more than 8,000 tires and had them taken to a recycling plant or gave them to Cass Community Social Services to be made into useful products. We hope to expand the tire sweep challenge to include all neighborhoods in the City.	Cadillac Urban Gardens on Merritt Street (CUGM)	CUGM is a collaborative project between SDEV, the Ideal Group, GM, businesses, residents, and volunteers that aims to create a zero waste garden while providing residents with fresh fruits and vegetables as well as a community gathering space.  The Ideal Group donated a vacant, former Cadillac Executive Parking lot as the space for the project, while GM repurposed 250 shipping crates to be used as raised vegetable planter beds. SDEV helped design the garden, and is responsible for managing the volunteer activities and maintaining the space. This year volunteers spent more 7,000 hours working in the garden. Most of the volunteers are children and young people. From residents to school groups to volunteer corps, CUGM sees dozens of new and familiar faces every week. The garden is open daily, so residents can come and pick what they need, and baskets of produce are put out daily for anyone in need to take home.	48210 Clean Up Collaborative	SDEV recently received an EPA Environmental Justice grant to address solid waste issues in the 48210 zip code. We will convene a diverse stakeholder collaborative who will identify two or three illegal dump sites to clean up and then repurpose into something that the community wants. -\tIncrease awareness of illegal dumping and proper solid waste disposal. The purpose of the program is to reduce the number of repeat dump sites; Reduce residents’ exposure to hazardous waste; Develop new community asset(s) i.e. parks, gardens or greenhouses; Reduce amount of material entering waste stream; And reuse, recycle and repurpose as much dumped material as possible.

Black Mothers’ Breastfeeding ClubTM is a FREE mother-led breastfeeding support group that meets in a community setting.  Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers come together for fellowship, sisterhood and breastfeeding support.	Community Approach to Breastfeeding Support Workshop Series	Our workshop series began in 2009, first titled “Community Breastfeeding”. The workshop series naturally transitioned into, “Cultural Competence in Breastfeeding Support for African Americans”. Workshops originated due to a need expressed by healthcare professionals that emerged out of our annual seminars. Through this workshop series, we have and continue to, provide culturally-appropriate and relevant strategies, information, applicable skills and action steps to agency employees that have an interest in maternal-child-health. Our focus is aligned with our mission to increase the awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding throughout the African American community.  We are decreasing the disparities in breastfeeding rates by providing real workshop sessions to agencies that service black families.

The FREE Project aims to address issues of social justice, restorative justice, and Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED). This framework includes three key components.\n\n1) Large scale vacant lot blight removal project via Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs); construction contractors registered with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). This provides much needed on-the-job training for DBEs who wish to become more involved in MDOTs projects.\n\n2) Workforce development and training opportunities for individuals who have a desire to become more involved in construction work, are unemployed, or face barriers to employment.\n\n3) Community-led redesign and maintenance efforts of the formerly blighted stretch of vacancy. Anchoring institutions and surrounding community stakeholders serve an irreplaceable role in the fight against blight.	gruberjk@gmail.com	Yes	No page yet... stay tuned!	No web yet... stay tuned!

We are partnering with the Bailey Park Project, a 501(c)3 dedicated to maintaining vacant lot throughout McDougall-Hunt while providing increased safety and improved quality of life for residents and surrounding school children.\n\nThe pilot site is 16 contiguous parcels, all vacant and in a significant state of disrepair - beyond the control of a small landscaping organization. Therefore, weve partnered with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program to perform initial phases of large scale blight removal. This project will be designed as a training program for the DBEs who wish to become more involved with MDOT Projects.\n\nThe residents and surrounding stakeholders have provided individual designs, which will be compiled into one professional design, and further synthesized into the blight removal/training program job specifications and work contract.

(Conner Cluster)\n\nBetter Block Detroit 2014 (BBD2014) will focus its rapid planning activities along Gratiot Avenue, between Conner and Rosemary. This corridor, while heavily trafficked by cars, bikes and pedestrians, lacks cohesive social and retail-based connectivity. Khalil Ligon, longtime district resident, urban planner and CEO of Vista Vantage Consulting Group, L3C, is leading the effort in partnership with the USGBC Detroit Regional Chapter Emerging Professionals. The group sought to involve active community groups in this area as well as green businesses across Detroit to design, implement and steward the project towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly development.\n\nBBD2014 will take place October 20-25. Our team of community members and the USGBC Emerging Professionals have been meeting since mid-September to identify and program a space in the neighborhood. The area we selected along Gratiot Avenue has a mix of active and vacant spaces. We want to create an informal gathering space that brings some vibrancy to the block and demonstrates what’s possible with more planning & resources. The site will feature community gathering spaces, pop-up shops, urban stormwater management and mock-protected bike lanes.\n\nBetter Block is not an event; rather, it is a quick neighborhood turnaround project to simulate an active, thriving block in a major city. Better Block is Detroit’s opportunity to take an idea and make it live in a relatively short period of time. Better Block Detroit provides a unique opportunity for Detroiters to come together and create their own vision of what everyday business and entertainment can look like.
